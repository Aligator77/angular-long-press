The **only required dependencies** are: \r\n\r\n*   [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org) (tested with 1.4.9 although it probably works with older versions)\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\nbower install angular-long-press--save\r\n\r\nAlternatively files can be downloaded [downloaded from Github](https://github.com/puneethrai/angular-long-press).\r\nand copy the files from `dist/`. Then add the sources to your code (adjust paths as needed) after \r\nadding the dependencies for Angular first:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<script src=\"../bower_components/angular/angular.min.js\"></script>\r\n<script src=\"/bower_components/angular-long-press/dist/angular-long-press.js\"></script>\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhichever method you choose the good news is that the overall size is very small: &lt; 2.5kb for all directives (~0.5kb with gzip compression!)\r\n\r\n\r\nAs soon as you've got all the files downloaded and included in your page you just need to declare a dependency on the `pr.longpress` [module](http://docs.angularjs.org/guide/module):   \r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nangular.module('myModule', ['pr.longpress']);\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Example\r\n\r\n## Markup\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<button on-long-press=\"onLongPress()\" on-touch-end=\"onTouchEnd()\" prevent-click=\"'true'\"></button>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Options\r\n\r\nThere are several options that you can set as attributes on the directive element\r\n\r\n1.  `on-long-press` : method to be called when long press event is triggerred\r\n2.  `on-touch-end` : method to be called when touch end or mouse up event is triggered\r\n3.  `prevent-click` : default true, to prevent click event getting triigered after long press is triggerred\r\n\r\n\r\n# Issues\r\n \r\nPlease check if issue exists and otherwise open issue in [github](https://github.com/deepu105/angular-clock/issues?state=open)\r\n\r\n**Please add a link to a plunker, jsbin, or equivalent.**\r\n\r\nThank you [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/BobNisco/9885852)\r\n\r\n\r\n# License\r\n\r\nangular-long-press.js is available under the [MIT license](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).",
